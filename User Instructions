# User Instructions

## Overview

- **Commander** - Talks to you, assigns tasks to soldiers
- **Soldiers** - Numbered workers (soldier-1, soldier-2, etc.) that do the actual coding

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Start Commander
Open a Cursor window, paste the Commander prompt.

### 2. Start Soldiers
For each soldier you want, open a new Cursor window and paste the Soldier prompt with their number:

> "You are soldier-1"

or

> "You are soldier 2"

The soldier will:
- Create its own directory at `agents/soldiers/soldier-1/`
- Create all its files
- Register itself
- Start watching for tasks

### 3. Use the System
Talk to Commander. It assigns tasks. Soldiers execute automatically.

---

## How Many Soldiers?

Start with 1-3 for small projects. Add more as needed.

You can have multiple soldiers doing similar work - they're generalists by default.

---

## Specialization (Optional)

For large codebases, Commander can assign soldiers to specific areas:
- "soldier-1 and soldier-2, focus on frontend"
- "soldier-3, you handle the backend"

This is **optional**. Small projects don't need it.

---

## Example Session

**You to Commander:**
> "Add a pause menu"

**Commander:**
> "Assigned to soldier-1. They're working on it."

[soldier-1 automatically wakes up, does the work]

**Commander (after completion):**
> "Done. soldier-1 created pause_menu.tscn and integrated it."

---

## Checking Status

Ask Commander:
- "What's soldier-1 doing?"
- "Are there any stuck soldiers?"
- "Show me what's been completed"

---

## Adding More Soldiers

Just start a new Cursor window with the soldier prompt:
> "You are soldier-4"

It will bootstrap itself and register.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Soldier not responding:**
- Check its status.json
- Check if file watcher is running
- Restart the soldier window

**Soldier confused about identity:**
- Tell it: "You are soldier-X" 
- Have it re-read its profile.json

**Task not picked up:**
- Verify task.json was written
- Check soldier's status.json
